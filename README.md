Django Track Bugz
===========

Will be an integrated web-based project management system featuring bug/issue tracking, scheduling and estimation reporting with REST API integration. 

The feature tracker allows users to manage, filter, sort and navigate a tree-structure of tasks, that contain information, tags, comments and attached files related to a particular issue.  Users may integrate their email accounts into the system to send/receive email and create issues regarding the same.
